This project is a Rubix cube which is rendered in both 3D and 2D. 
You can click anywhere on the start screen to begin.

Instructions:
    Cell click: click a cell to selected to choose what face is being rotated
    
    R click: when you press the r key and have any cell along the middle 4 faces
    selected it will rotate that row around the board counter clockwise

    W click: when you press the w key and have any cell along the middle 4 faces
    selected it will rotate that row around the board clockwise

    L click: when you press the l key with any cell in either the right or left
    sides selected that face will rotate counter clockwise

    J click: when you press the j key with any cell in either the right or left
    sides selected that face will rotate clockwise

If you would like to change the front face simply rotate each layer to the 
desired face or the columns.
You can toggle between the 2D and 3D view as well as use the same rotation keys 
while in 3D. The solver prints the key presses and selected cell position into 
the terminal
